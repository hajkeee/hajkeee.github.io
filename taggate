A large part of our employees were also on vacation, so there’s no final decision yet. I haven’t received a 100% confirmation whether this would be a simple implementation for us when it comes to CDN.
But in my free time, I tested this solution, and indeed, it looks like it’s much harder for browsers to block GTM. However, this doesn’t help with data attribution, which is a more crucial element than simply loading GTM. The fact that Safari removes the gclid means that right now I’m focusing more on reproducing _gcl_aw in the browser, and if everything works as I expect, that should solve the issue.

On my side, I tested the integration with CloudFlare and SiteCore and noticed exactly what I mentioned in the previous sentence. The number of sessions increased in GA4, as did the metrics, but most of this growth is attributed to (not set) and (direct).

Another problem I’m trying to verify is that connecting GTM through CDN happens at the entire site level — all domains, all UAT, SIT, and so on (this is what I observed when connecting through CloudFlare), which makes testing problematic.

As soon as I can discuss this topic with our internal teams, I’ll be able to get back to you with an answer.

Thank you!
