Today we have released tags on our products, so you should be receiving information in Adobe Analytics. However, we still haven't gained access and the ability to fully track the customer journey due to the lack of access to third-party integration services.

<script>
  document.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    if (event.target.tagName === 'A') {
      var clickUrl = event.target.href;
      var clickText = event.target.textContent;
      
      dataLayer.push({
        'event': 'Link_click',
        'Click URL': clickUrl,
        'Click text': clickText
      });
    }
  });
</script>



A data layer is a JavaScript object that contains information about a website or web application that can be used by third-party tools for analytics, marketing, and other purposes. It typically includes information such as page URLs, user IDs, product information, and other data that can be used to track user behavior and provide insights into how visitors interact with a site.

To create a data layer, you need to add JavaScript code to your website or web application that defines the data layer object and populates it with relevant information. Here's an example of how you might create a simple data layer object:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <script>
      // Create digitalData layer object
      window.digitalData = window.digitalData || {};
      
      // Populate digitalData layer with information
      digitalData = {
        applicationName : "Carbon Planner - Customer Portal",
        brandName: "NatWest",
        stepName : "Overwiev",
        sectionName: "Data Target",
        subSectionName : "Water",
        userId : '12345'
      };
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your website content here -->
  </body>
</html>


In this example, we create a data layer object using the window.dataLayer global variable. We then populate the data layer with information about the page category, page title, and user ID using the dataLayer.push() method. This information can then be accessed by third-party tools for analytics, marketing, and other purposes.




Q1:
In the first quarter, I made significant strides in enhancing my data visualization skills. As part of my learning plan, I took the initiative to start studying Looker Studio and Tableau, two powerful data visualization tools. Through my studies, I gained valuable insights into how to create dynamic and visually compelling visualizations that help to communicate complex data insights in a clear and concise manner. Additionally, I completed the Adobe Analytics configuration course, which provided me with a deep understanding of how to configure and optimize analytics tracking systems to ensure accurate data capture and analysis. Overall, these efforts have enabled me to greatly improve my data visualization skills, giving me the tools and knowledge needed to create impactful and insightful data visualizations that can help drive informed decision-making.
Q1: 
In the upcoming quarter, I am excited to continue building on my data visualization skills by pursuing more advanced training opportunities. Specifically, I am looking forward to exploring further courses on Adobe Learning Platform to deepen my knowledge and skills in this area. By completing these courses, I hope to gain more specialized knowledge in advanced data visualization techniques, such as creating interactive dashboards, designing compelling visualizations, and leveraging data to tell a compelling story. Ultimately, I am confident that these efforts will help me become a more effective data analyst and better equipped to deliver insights that drive business growth and success.
To achieve success both now and in the future, I am committed to improving my skills in data visualization, analytics, and the tools that are most relevant to data analysis. By focusing on these key areas, I hope to enhance my ability to work with data in a meaningful way, and to derive insights that can help drive business success. I understand that this will require ongoing effort and dedication, but I am excited about the prospect of building a strong foundation of knowledge and skills that will serve me well throughout my career.
Q1: In terms of my personal development plan, I've made significant progress this quarter. For one, I've honed my ability to create documentation that's accessible to non-technical users. Additionally, I've gained valuable experience with data visualization using Looker. Furthermore, I was fortunate enough to participate in a Google Cloud platform learning opportunity, which gave me a solid foundation in both machine learning and BigQuery.
