A data layer is a JavaScript object that contains information about a website or web application that can be used by third-party tools for analytics, marketing, and other purposes. It typically includes information such as page URLs, user IDs, product information, and other data that can be used to track user behavior and provide insights into how visitors interact with a site.

To create a data layer, you need to add JavaScript code to your website or web application that defines the data layer object and populates it with relevant information. Here's an example of how you might create a simple data layer object:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <script>
      // Create digitalData layer object
      window.digitalData = window.digitalData || {};
      
      // Populate digitalData layer with information
      digitalData = {
        applicationName : "Carbon Planner - Customer Portal",
        brandName: "NatWest",
        stepName : "Overwiev",
        sectionName: "Data Target",
        subSectionName : "Water",
        userId : '12345'
      };
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your website content here -->
  </body>
</html>


In this example, we create a data layer object using the window.dataLayer global variable. We then populate the data layer with information about the page category, page title, and user ID using the dataLayer.push() method. This information can then be accessed by third-party tools for analytics, marketing, and other purposes.
